        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">
            Steve Jobs was born to Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali on February 24, 1955, in
            San Francisco. Due
            to various circumstances, he was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, who raised him as their own. Growing up,
            Jobs showed an early interest in electronics and mechanics, and his parents nurtured his passion. He had a
            rebellious streak and struggled with authority in school. However, a fourth-grade teacher named Imogene Hill
            had a profound impact on him, motivating him to excel academically. Jobs skipped the fifth grade and
            transferred to a different school, where he faced social challenges.<br>

            In 1967, the Jobs family moved to a new home in Los Altos, California. It was in this neighborhood that Jobs
            would meet Bill Hewlett, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, who gave him a summer job and further fueled his
            interest in electronics. In 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College but dropped out after one semester due to
            financial constraints. However, he continued auditing classes that interested him, including a calligraphy
            course, which later inspired the typography of Apple products.<br>

            These formative experiences would shape Jobs' path to becoming one of the most influential figures in the
            tech industry. With his co-founding of Apple Inc., the introduction of iconic products like the Macintosh,
            iPod, iPhone, and iPad, and his visionary approach to design and user experience, Steve Jobs transformed
            multiple industries and left an indelible mark on the world. His relentless pursuit of excellence,
            entrepreneurial spirit, and innovative mindset continue to inspire countless individuals today.<br></p><br>
